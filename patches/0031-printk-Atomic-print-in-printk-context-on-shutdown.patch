Subject: [PATCH 31/46] printk: Atomic print in printk context on shutdown

For nbcon consoles, normally the printing is handled by the
dedicated console printing threads. However, on shutdown the
printing threads may not get a chance to print the final
messages.

When shutting down or rebooting (system_state > SYSTEM_RUNNING),
perform atomic printing from the printk() caller context.
